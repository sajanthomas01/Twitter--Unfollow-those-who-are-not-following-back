# Twitter--Unfollow-those-who-are-not-following-back
This is a script which can be run on the console of google chrome to unfollow those who are not following us back in twitter. There are some issues with scrolling and unfollowing the next set but for the purpose of unfollowing it works :D

# How to use
* Go to the page which shows list of followers
* Open Developer tools 
* Go to console and copy paste the code to the console
* Thats it :)


> This script may not be the optimized one and this will not work if twitter changes the structure of their page :)
